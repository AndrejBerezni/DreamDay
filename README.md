# Dream Day
Dream Day is a wedding day planner that allows you to create and organize tasks for your special day. The project was built using **JavaScript, HTML,** and **CSS** on the front end, with **Webpack** used to bundle the code, and **Firebase** in the back end. Firebase's **Firestore** was used to store data in a non-relational database, and **Firebase authentication** was used to allow users to sign in using their **Google** account. Background images were generated using **Midjourney**.
